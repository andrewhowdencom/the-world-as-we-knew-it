# The world as we knew it

## What

So, I've always kind of been fascinated with the collapse of modern society. Morbid though it may seem, I'm somehow
compelled to think and prepare for some sort of worldwide collapse. Practically I think this will not happen; even when
things *do* go south on a monumental scale, that lasts but a few years before human normality kicks back in, and we
get on with our (perhaps very different) lives.

However, I think it's interesting to explore what could fundamentally change our word, and the ways in which it would
happen. Unfortunately, such macabre line if mental inquiry does not have such a productive outcome, unless the world
does collapse. However, there is perhaps one reasonably legitimate mechanism to explore such a topic, which is the
production of fiction.

So, I'm going to have a go at writing a book. I quite enjoy the act of writing, and the topic is one that has no
bearing upon my life and thus lends itself to idle thinking without consequence.

I have no idea whether I'll be successful in this endeavour. But I know the surest way to not be successful is not to
try at all, which compels me to at least create this repository.
