# Theme

[All stories need a theme](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_stanton_the_clues_to_a_great_story); a governing notion
that they keep attempting to revisit. So, the question becomes, what is the theme that we derive from investigating
societal collapse? Perhaps it's worthwhile thinking why this topic matter -- societal collapse is one of of great
attraction to me personally, but I have never medititated on why it should be this way.

## Wonder

Defined by wikipedia as:

> an emotion comparable to surprise that people feel when perceiving something rare or unexpected

So, in terms of a story, it is to subvert the expected in ways that give us hope, but do not immediately answer it.
