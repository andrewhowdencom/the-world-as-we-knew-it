# Theme

[All stories need a theme](https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_stanton_the_clues_to_a_great_story); a governing notion
that they keep attempting to revisit. So, the question becomes, what is the theme that we derive from investigating
societal collapse? Perhaps it's worthwhile thinking why this topic matter -- societal collapse is one of of great
attraction to me personally, but I have never medititated on why it should be this way.

## Notions

### Absent the criticality of life and death decisions, is it possible to obtain meaning

Historically my life has been characterised by a set of decisions that have unforgiving consequences. It was but a
short period in which I was in an environment in which I was in a very literal way the only master of my own destiny,
but it left such an impression that I find myself left in perpetuity looking for a way to return to it.

Additionally, such context is enormously powerful in a world in which the majority of context is derived from
non-consequential decisions such as whether or not a given thing will end in a promotion, or not. But it also remains
unsatisfying for the same purpose; I remain thirsty for crisis while making decisions that singularly reduce the risk
of it happening.

Is there a mechanism by which we can return to meaning? Additionally, for this to be explored, our character would
need to be thrown into such an environment in which they were required to determine their own future.

## Wonder

Defined by wikipedia as:

> an emotion comparable to surprise that people feel when perceiving something rare or unexpected

So, in terms of a story, it is to subvert the expected in ways that give us hope, but do not immediately answer it.
