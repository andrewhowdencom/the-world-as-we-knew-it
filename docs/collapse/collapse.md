# Ways in which society can collapse

Google [helpfully defines "Society"](https://www.google.de/search?q=define%3A+society)  as:

> the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.

Accordingly, the break down of society is when society is becomes, in some fashion, less "ordered". Interestingly,
this definition does not preclude the idea that societies can be both ordered and destructive (at least for some
constituent).

This bizarre notion means that one could argue society has already begun it's collapse, it's merely not affecting those
of my societal bracket. Indeed, one could consider the notion that society is always in a state of collapse, much as
a distributed computer system is always in a state of failure -- it's merely how much of the system is operating within
reasonable bounds, and how much is being destroyed. Areas in which it could be argued that society is currently
collapsed are:

- Prison
- Drug addiction
- Mass migration and incarceration of migrants
- Slavery
- Poverty

Each of these properties of collapse indicates some "known state", or defined bounds at which life is reasonable. It
stands to reason, then that when those bounds are violated the society is in some form of collapse.

The UN [defines a set of "Human Rights"](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) that all societies
"must" endeavour to adhere to for all of their constituents. However, practically, it seems many societies either
tacitly or are in direct violation of these norms, and they are thus adhered to only in lip service only.

Accordingly, to summarise this notion, I will define societal collapse as a form of collective desperation, in which
the bounds of trust between people can no longer be relied upon, and for which each person must be forced into a sense
of reductionist and more brutal behaviours.

It stands to reason that this also makes for a recovery, over a period following the collapse. At this time it's 
unclear how one makes the step between failed state and recovery, but it may be possible to do so, and would give
an appropriate ending for the book.

// Todo: Let's make society collapse off a given set of peoples good intentions. To truly drive the horror of this
   notion home, it must be possible for each person to see themselves as both the cause and result of such collapse.

// Todo: How does society collapse, exactly? IT must be a combination of things; it has not collapsed so far in any
   resilient way with a single, even if catastrophic event.

// Todo: Cascading failure of society, and the notion of free agents within that society restoring some sort of order
   by propagating their advantage

// Todo: Examine other societal failures, particularly where there was a significant negative impact on the broader 
   population.

// Todo: Examine parallels between such collapse and the "poverty trap"
