# Commune

The ending of our story. Given both food and economic collapse, we need some sort of stable structure that is both
not immediately accessible but supplies the requirements for food, water and residence for a large-ish number
of people.

## Population

2000

## Environment

The commune is established in a set of caves, originally set aside for the purpose of a seed bank. Fairly temperate,
but not 100% stable. 

Chosen initially as there was a single point of entry and large area that had been somewhat retrofitted to be
habitable, making it a fairly easy place to defend.Â However, the planet is still habitable (though somewhat barren)
and thus humans are also moving outside the cave system once again.

## Water Source

An underground lake, not immediately apparent when the seed farm was built in, but when resided in for a period of
time and explored it was there.

## Power Source

Initially none, but eventually solar stolen from nearby houses.
