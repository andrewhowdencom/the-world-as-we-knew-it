# Timeline

A book usually follows some linear form of time, however such a collapse is invariably a lengthy procedure. It can be
perhaps addressed by "living in the moment", but recapping within the story each individual component of the collapse
within the timeline the story allows.

Stories that follow this pattern include:

- "Transcendence"

## General pattern

Stories that bind us, and that require us to investigate further to understand their outcome create a sense of drama.
To quote William Archer:

> â€œDrama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."

To this end, we much develop our characters with a model that they can make both good and bad choices, and it's
entirely defensible to adhere to both choices.

### The end

It's useful for the reader to know the notion of how the story ends, in a limited view. Given the context behind how
this story flows, and it's nature (i.e. the collapse of society), it's perhaps useful to leave them in a view where
the problems still remain, but are adhered to as society renormalises.

Given the nature of the story, it stands to reason that this normalisation should be radically different to the
previous and histortical normality (i.e. something like now). Perhaps some sort of hyper-controlled and human
engineered environment? The nature of the world does not have to chance to, simply humanities role within it.

Some sort of human terrarium maybe, still concieving engineering challenges but with enough hope that the reader
considers the story "solved".
