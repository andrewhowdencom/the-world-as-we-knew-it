# Timeline

A book usually follows some linear form of time, however such a collapse is invariably a lengthy procedure. It can be
perhaps addressed by "living in the moment", but recapping within the story each individual component of the collapse
within the timeline the story allows.

Stories that follow this pattern include:

- "Transcendence"

## General pattern

Stories that bind us, and that require us to investigate further to understand their outcome create a sense of drama.
To quote William Archer:

> â€œDrama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."

To this end, we much develop our characters with a model that they can make both good and bad choices, and it's
entirely defensible to adhere to both choices.

## Timeline

### Global Warming

- Harder to grow food
- No water in many areas
- Large amounts of the population displaced due to famine

### Sickness

- Sickness generated from migrant population
- Large pools of the population dying
- The collapse of the global logistics chain

### Famine

- No logistics chain, no crops
- A year goes past, no food
- No food, an increase in pressure on government officials

### The coup

The collapse of modern society is perhaps best represented by a coup; that is, the military taking care of the failed
government state.

### Collapse and authoritarianism

- The military is too fragmented due to leadership lost during the sickness
- The monopolisation of resources, controlling of industry

### A new round of sickness

- Unable to regulate industry, leads to a combination of joblessness and supply failure
- Water reservoirs are unclean, dysentery breaks out
- Irrational violence

### Discovery of the seed bank

### Formation of a society around efforts to build small, highly regulated crops

### The end

It's useful for the reader to know the notion of how the story ends, in a limited view. Given the context behind how
this story flows, and it's nature (i.e. the collapse of society), it's perhaps useful to leave them in a view where
the problems still remain, but are adhered to as society renormalises.

Given the nature of the story, it stands to reason that this normalisation should be radically different to the
previous and histortical normality (i.e. something like now). Perhaps some sort of hyper-controlled and human
engineered environment? The nature of the world does not have to chance to, simply humanities role within it.

Some sort of human terrarium maybe, still concieving engineering challenges but with enough hope that the reader
considers the story "solved".
