# Timeline

A book usually follows some linear form of time, however such a collapse is invariably a lengthy procedure. It can be
perhaps addressed by "living in the moment", but recapping within the story each individual component of the collapse
within the timeline the story allows.

Stories that follow this pattern include:

- "Transcendence"

## General pattern

Stories that bind us, and that require us to investigate further to understand their outcome create a sense of drama.
To quote William Archer:

> â€œDrama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."

To this end, we much develop our characters with a model that they can make both good and bad choices, and it's
entirely defensible to adhere to both choices.
