# Chapter 1

Joseph sat staring at his computer and sipping at his now cold cup of "tea", thinking to himself. The computer, as usual
refusing to yield to his desires, showed only some text in large, red letters: "Cannot connect to upstream server:
connection timed out". Joseph sighed to himself; this particular problem can wait until tomorrow. Arising from his
chair he grunted a good night to the other tech in the room and wandered towards the door. He knocked the button and
the pneumatic door gave a sharp "hiss" as it opened, revealing the stark passage way between the offices and the
general dormitories. Joseph joined the general passage of people, filing out of their respective work areas as the day
came to a close.

Over the general babble of the crowed on their way to the communal hall for dinner, Joseph heard his name ring out:

"Joseph? Joseph! Wait up -- hang on"

Hearing and recognising the unique, brutish tones Joseph stepped off to the side of traffic and turned looking for
the owner of the voice. He quickly spotted the imposing figure of Oscar not so far behind him, jostling those slower
than he on their path to ther meal.

"Oscar! How are you" he asked as Oscar arrived beside him. "Good, man, you?" he replied. So it went on for some
minutes, exchanging the evenings idle pleasantries until Oscar switched his tons: "You know, it's been two years as of
today."

"Two years?" Joseph replied, attempting to recall both the date and what had happened two years before. "Yeah", said
Oscar, "Two years since the coup d'Ã©tat". Joseph's mind immediately landed on both the date, and event Oliver
mentioned. They both walked in silence for a moment, contemplating for a moment the years between. "How's Claire?"
Joseph asked, in reference to Oscars partner. "I'm not sure yet", he replied. Continuing on, he observed "She doesn't
like to think too much about it. I don't think many do."

Joseph considered this in silence. It was an entirely defensible attitude. The military coup had been the proverbial
straw that had broken the camels back, plunging their world into chaos, then sickness and then famine. It was only six
months prior that they'd come across the seed bank storage, and only in recent months with the retrofitting of the
caves in which the seed bank was stores into some sort of apartment complex that society had regained some sembelence
of normality.
